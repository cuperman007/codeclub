STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths. So where do you start?

## Learn

There are plenty of free resources available to help you learn about STEM subjects. Here are some of our favourites.

- [Hour of code](learn/hour-of-code.md)
- [Tinkercad](learn/tinkercad.md)

## Volunteer

We'd like to see all the children of Penkridge have the opportunity to find which aspects of STEM learning they enjoy the most. If you can spend an hour a week to help children learn and enjoy STEM activities please get in touch, or contact one of the following organistations:

- [STEMNET](https://db.stemnet.org.uk/)
- [Codeclub](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/start-a-club/volunteers)
